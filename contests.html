              <p class="card-text">The Student-companion program is 
                  an initiative of the Computer Science fraternity 
                  to extend guided assistance to the CS freshmen by 
                  their seniors from the department. The program was 
                  upheld under the leadership of Ms. Priyanka Bamne, 
                  who is also the mentor of the Club.

                The members of the Computer Club were the 
                student-companions for the program. Each member 
                was appointed 6 juniors who became his/her buddies. 
                The student-companions then interacted with their 
                buddies via various media.</p>
                <p>
                    The key reason for the adaptation of this program
                    was the mere fellow feeling that when students begin
                    on their journey into a college, they face a myriad 
                    of problems, from being unable to find the labs to 
                    being indecisive and have equivocal ideas about their 
                    career, stream, department future prospects and in the 
                    worst case, bullying. This ambiguity or vulnerability 
                    can sometimes lead to frustration among students and may 
                    result in irksome consequences. And then there are times 
                    that students may feel disoriented and unsupported. So, 
                    to relieve the forthcoming freshmen from these distresses 
                    the department undertook the responsibility to aid the 
                    juniors and lend them a clearer perspective on what's what,
                    and a firmer knowledge of why they are here and what's the 
                    right way to be. The student-companions were available for 
                    their juniors as much as they could be, and helped clarify 
                    their queries, doubts etc to the best of their knowledge.

                    Since the program has started, the juniors feel much more 
                    confident and encouraged. They found on introspection that 
                    a lot of their inhibitions and irrational ideas were shooed 
                    away. A lot of them also developed a sense of belonging which 
                    is hard to attain in freshmen year with the virtue of this program. 
                    And it is through this program the senior-junior gaps have narrowed, 
                    and camaraderie has risen, which is way more than we had expected and 
                    are wholeheartedly proud of. The overall feedback of the program has 
                    been overwhelming, the students and the senior were more comfortable 
                    now than they would have been otherwise.

                    Each of us involved in this program will continue to undertake the 
                    responsibilities that entail, to continue to help, assist, guide and 
                    support our juniors in every way possible.
